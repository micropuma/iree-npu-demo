# IREE NPU Demo  

This repo contains a backend plugin demo to help integrate a npu backend into upstream IREE infrastructure.     

## Architecture Overview  

## Building  

## Testing

## Current State  
This repo currently fulfill following targets:  
- ✅ A minimal, easy-to-follow example showing how to add a new backend to IREE through its plugin system.  
- 🚧 Provides a complete compilation pipeline for a demo NPU backend, fully testable end-to-end using PyTorchSim. (**TODO**)
